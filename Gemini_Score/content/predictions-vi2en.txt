The method of analysis was evaluated on the UV-Vis 1800 device of Shimadzu with the appropriate linearity (R2 > 0.995), the linear interval 10-70 mg GAE L– 1, the repetitive and repetitiveness (%RSD) were 0.79 and 1.2% for the date and middle of the day) and the high recovery rate (over 1% for standard samples).
Total polyphenol levels (the average value of mg GAE g - 1 dry mass in parentheses) show the tendency to decrease between tea samples, specifically white tea (206.62) ~ Green tea (7.33) > red tea (167.42) > Octalong (39.18) because of the difference of oxygenation during fermentation, especially for red tea and Octalong.
The polyphenol content of the tea water shows increased general trends by increasing the temperature of the tea, except for the apparent pneumolong tea sample, which may be due to the “cursion ” structure of this tea, leading to the longer-strinking time for polyphenol to be released properly and completely.
This study contributed a modest part to enrich the data for Vietnamese tea products in the context of high production and export of tea.

Three p53 gene, rarture1, wnt and fish Medaka were chosen to study the toxicity of Dichlorodphenyl-Mtloroetine (DDT) to reach fish embryo (08 days) and adult Medaka fish (03 months).
TEM and real-time PCR methods are used to test changes in liver tissue structure and genetic manifestations.
The results of TEM scan revealed the obvious difference between the evidence sample and the prototype.
The adult Medaka fish exposed to 1 Octag / LDD in 24 hours had distorted liver cells, many hollow lipit particles, broken sinoid grids; lysosome was intractable, many degenerative bubbles appeared.
The results of real-time PCR show that DDT affects the development, separation and growth of cells at embryo stage and genetic manifestations in adulthood.
The three p53, rar 171, and the wnt in the fish embryo have changed dramatically and tended to be inhibited by the exposure of 1700 05g / LDV, and the value of the recording was 0.6.9 and 5.4 times compared with the sample (recesss).
For adult fish, the manifestation of the gene was lower than the fish embryo for real-time PCR values in the three p53 gene, rar71 and wng1 were 0.9 and 0.36 and 0.09; 0.093 and 0.09 times after exposure to 1500 and 1700 gg / LD.
This results show that genetic manifestations depend on the growth stages of cells as well as the doses of exposed chemicals.
Segregation as well as growth and growth of cells at embryonic stage and adulthood affect different genetic manifestations of cells.

Results: The study showed that the protaper camera was fast and maintained the initial diaphragm of the tube is better than the initial splint ProTaper turn hand (P <0.05).
Both types maintain good working length and create most of the tubular tubes of the same round form at the third level (P > 0%).
Conclusion: In the condition of this study, both tools are equally effective in preparing the tube and are safe when used.
However, the proTate pin is better at maintaining the initial diaphragm curve than of the proTater wheel.
Objectives: This study conducted the effective comparison of the proTater and the proTarter Clinch of the machine in preparing the tube for the change in the diaphragm, the shift in the working length, the transcution of the tube at the third part of the end, and the amount of preparation.
Methods: This is a study of microtro-printing with the subject of 30 sub-sortcutor teeth, divided by random groups and rechecked by t for two independent patterns to ensure that there is no difference between the two groups of the transvestitation and the length of the tube.
Evaluation of the changes in the diaphragm and the length of the tube are based on pre-mediated and after preparation.
The teeth after preparing were cross-sectioned at 3 mm at the point of the nodes to evaluate cross-section in the third part of the top.

The patient’s knowledge of the dietary regimen disease
Background: Infarction is common, can recur multiple times and become chronic inflammation or acute inflammation on the ground.
Good knowledge of dietary regimen for inflammation is proportional to re-enteration due to recurrence.
Objectives: To understand the patient’s knowledge of the diet of inflammation.
Study the forms of patients who are exposed to nutritional regimen for inflammation.
Methods: The study was conducted on 77 patients admitted to the hospital with diagnosis of thrombomyitis (the exception of streptitis) by cross-section.
Results: 68.83% knew that fat was to be restricted, 70.12% knew that sheep, rust, 80.51% knew that alcoholbending, beer, 62.23% needed to quit smoking, 75.32% should be eaten.
However, 59.74% of patients thought that the inflammation needed cereal types, 44.15% of patients were not aware if the inflammation should be eaten, 32.46% felt that fiber should not be eaten.
In the case of dietal forms for inflammation, 20,79% of patients were consulted by health workers on dietary regimes, with 41.55% studied by media and 37.66% studied by acquaintances.
Conclusions: Good knowledge of nutrition for inflammation is proportional to re-integration due to recurrence.
The level of necrosis in the serum of patients with psorphosis at the hospital of the city of Lake City
Beginning: The TNF - a cytokinine prespiracy is highly effective with the tremendous effect in the casserole in the psorption of psorption.
The quantitative of serum TNF-DRA can be recommended as a tool for assessing the severity of the disease and following treatment.
This study has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of psorption disease in Vietnam, from which to provide a basis for observation and treatment of diseases that are more effective than the goal: To determine the rate of TNF-bar concentrations in disease-sclip patients and compare the concentration of TNF-bar to clinicality, disease time and early output of stenosis.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was done on 40 healthy people and 60 stenosis patients.
Results: TNF - ENF level in serum at average psorption patients was 6,61 + 5.00 pg / mL, higher than the normal group (p<0.000).
The TNF level - 06 in the patient's serum with psorption and p scales is higher than the value of normal people but the difference has no statistics (p = 0.748 and p = 1.767).
The complete body of pg / mL is a disease with TNF level - 06 in the highest serum (13.77 + 4.2 pg / mL), higher than normal people (p = 0.000) and higher, more significant, relative to the stenosis (p = 0.0000) and joint sinaves (p = 0.000).
There is a statistics difference between the level of TNF-Centrology and the weight of the joint plier scales (p = 0.01).
Conclusion: Test of serum TNF-DRI levels is a test that provides useful information that helps us to understand the biological network of psorption.
The 24-hour-performance study of blood pressure in patients with prostatic blood pressure has changed the syndrome of conversion
Base: Hemorrhagic form 24 hours had to do with the complications in the prime NA.
However, the study of 24 hours of blood pressure in patients with HCCH syndrome has not been much in Vietnam. The purpose was: To understand the 24-hour change of blood pressure in patients with HCCH patients who had the disease with HCCH. OBD: The study of the cross-section had an analysis. The result was: In this study, 54 patients with HCH and 44 patients with HCH patients with HCH patients with no HCH (C) age was equal to the same age and 24 blood pressure.
Diagnosis of the original TRI, by the standard of JCI VII, was diagnosed with HCCH according to the standards of the International Racist League of Swabs, applied to the Asian-Pacea Pacific region (IDFA).
Results showed: The group with HCCH had a higher rate of non-dipper (6.7%) than of the syndrome group (5.7%%), however, the difference of the ratios was unpredictable (p > 0.5%).
In the TCCH group there was a higher rate of non-dipper (66.7%) than the group without cardiac complications (61.6%), the difference was not calculated (p > 0.5%).
In the group of eye complications with HCCH the non-dipper rate (79.2%) was higher than the group without eye complications (0.5%) with p <0.5%.
In the renal complications group, renal disease has HCCH the non-dipper rate (83%) higher than the group without kidney complications (52.9%) with p <0.5%.
In the group of brain complications with HCCH has a higher rate of non-dipper (73.4%) than the group with no brain complications (5.5.5%), the difference had no statistics (p > 0.5). Conclusion: There was a 24 - hour rise of non-dipper levels in the proliferated stenosis (emp, eye, kidney, and brain) with HCH (CCH) compared to non-restrially HCCH (p).
